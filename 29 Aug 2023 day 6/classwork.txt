 A Simple Case on ER Modelling
•	Goal – to demonstrate how to build an E-R model from a simple Statement of Objectives of a movie store. ( given very clearly in statement forms)
Scenario:
•	A video store rents movies to members.
•	Each movie in the store has a title and is identified by a unique movie number.
•	A movie can be in VHS, VCD, or DVD format.
•	Each movie belongs to one of a given set of categories (action, adventure, comedy, ... )
•	The store has a name and a (unique) phone number for each member.
•	Each member may provide a favorite movie category (used for marketing purposes).
•	There are two types of members: 
o	Golden Members:
o	Bronze Members:
•	Using  their credit cards gold members can rent one or more movies and bronze members max. of one movie.  
•	A member may have a number of dependents (with known names).
•	Each dependent is allowed to rent one (1) movie at a time.
